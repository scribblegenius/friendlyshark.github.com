# to a variable. We'll do this for each our metadata fields.

# at title_search, see how we use one group to match on the presence of "title:".
# 
# Also, note how in the second group is a named group -- we use ?p<name> .
# 
# Finally, note that we're passing the re.IGNORECASE flag as an optional
# argument to re.compile. We're doing this because it's human beings who create
# the metadata headers at the top of Project gutenberg docs, and we want to account 
# for possibility of "title: Some Title", "Title: Some Title", and "TITLE: Some Title").

# if you need more explanation. It's a highly productive built in function, and there are
# common problems that you'll encounter as a programmer that enumerate is great for.
